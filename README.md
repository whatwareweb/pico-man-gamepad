# Pico Dual Gamepad

This firmware turns a Raspberry Pi Pico or any RP2040 based board into a quad gamepad with 4 joysticks and 4 buttons.

To install the firmware just hold down the BOOTSEL button when you plug in your Pico, it will appear as a drive onto which you can drag a firmware.uf2 file located in the Releases tab.
